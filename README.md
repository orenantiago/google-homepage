# Google Home Page #
This is a Google home page that I made for The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css) to learn some HTML & CSS skills :)  
This is not an actual search-engine, is just a simple copy of the Google home page, and It's not intended to be accurate.
The result can be seen [here](https://renantsilva.github.io/google-homepage/).
